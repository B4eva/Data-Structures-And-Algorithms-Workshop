# Day 1 Outline

- definition
- arrays
  - 1-dimension
  - coding: find biggest number in array
  - N-dim
  - coding: diagonal difference of square matrix

- Recursion
  - explain (fxn calls itself, base case)
  - coding: fibonacci (recursive)
  - coding: array sum (recursive). Given A = [1,2,3], find the sum recursively
  - coding: array sum (iterative) - explain difference between iterative

- Sorting
  - e.g bubble sort.
  - write the function. Use a siple case to visualize the swaps e.g [2,3,1]
  - coding: Given a list of prices of items: prices = [1,2,3,4], and an amount of money k = 7, what's the maximum number of items you can buy?
  - Just say there are several other sorts. e.g insertion sort. Don't explain it.
  N.b The objective is not to teach the fastest sort, but to see if the student realises that the solution requires a sort.

- Searching
  - linear search. Used mostly when data is unsorted.
  - coding: find the biggest number in an *unsorted* array
  - binary search: Used when data is sorted. Faster. 
  - coding: Find a value in a *sorted* array.
  - N.B Both accomplish the same thing. Just one is faster if the data is sorted.
