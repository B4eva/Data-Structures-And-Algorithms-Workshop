# Assignments for week 1

You will find assignments as issues. 
The issues will have labels that tell you the diffifulty of the task. You are not required to solve all. But obviously, you are encouraged to try your best to solve them before the next session on Friday Night @9pm.

## How to submit assignment

1. If you don't yet have folder, create one with your name under week1/assignments directory. Just the way I created mine. (week1/assignments/acha-bill). It should contain a README.md with a smalld introduction about you. You can send a PR to create one or create one along with your first solution you submit.
2. All assignments that you submit will be to your personal folder in the form of a pull request. See https://github.com/jsacademyio/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Workshop/pull/11
3. You can use any language that you want.
4. When you submit you own, we will use the PR to discuss any ideas and talk about your solution.
5. This  also gives yoo a chance to keep refining your solutions.
