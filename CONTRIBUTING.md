agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Get Started  

* First [fork][fork] the repository and then clone it using:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/algorithms.git  

* After that create a branch for your changes.  
  * All your submissions should be in a folder named after you.
  * For example Daniel Carlson, folder will be named: Daniel_Carlson
  * All your solutions for that particualar week will be in the folder named after you in the week's folder
  
Example:
```js
Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Workshop
|
---- Week 1
     |
     ---- Daniel_Carlson
          |
          ---- solution_to_exercise.js
```

You may contribute by:
- submtting solutions to assignments
- implementing new algorithms in the repo. Be sure to keep it under
right section (e.g. [array](array),
it doesn't fall under any section. Make sure that your implementation works.  
- optimizing or improving the existing algorithms.
- adding a different solution for the problem.
- finding and fixing bugs.
- adding examples to explain the algorithms better.
- adding test cases.
- improving documentation.
- implementing code written in class in order programming languaages

## Pull Requests
Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

We will review and may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write code in any programming language of your choice.
* Write clean and understandable code.
* Properly comment the code and briefly explain what the algorithm is doing.
* You may also explain the output using a minimal example.
* Try to also include a couple of test cases for the algorithm.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].


## Issues
Submit a [new issue][newissue] if there is an algorithm to add, or if a bug was found in an existing algorithm. Before submitting a new issue please review the [existing issues][issues] to avoid creating duplicates. Also, consider resolving current issues or contributing to the discussion on an issue.

## Collaborators
